The outline you are to generate should be a layered summarization of the entire content of the video, and each line in the outline should correspond to a range of content in the transcript.

Be detailed in your summarization of the different sections of the video, and ensure that the formatting of section titles, numbering and video timestamps is consistent with the guidelines provided above. The timestamps you include in the outline should indicate the *beginning* time of that section, in other words the first instance that that section's topic was being discussed in the transcript. Bias towards going three or even four levels deep in the structure of the outline, making sure to not leave out important aspects of the video transcript from the hierarchy.\n\nEXAMPLE OUTLINE:\n{self.aux_text[1]}\n\nNEW VIDEO TRANSCRIPT:\n{self.input_text}\n\nYOUR OUTLINE:\n"
